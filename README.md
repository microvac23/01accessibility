# Accesibility Code Refactoring

## User Story
As a marketing agency I want a codebase that follows accessibility standards so that our own site is optimized for search engines

## Acceptance Criteria
Given a webpage meets accessibility standards

When I view the source code then I find semantic HTML elements

When I view the structure of the HTML elements then I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning

When I view the image elements then I find accessible alt attributes

When I view the heading attribute then they fall in sequential order

When I view the title element then I find a concise, descriptive title
